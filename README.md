## Capabilities
- Reading from UART in text or hex mode
- Sending commands
- Sending AT commands
- Sending fast commands
- Sending binary packets (in hex)
- Baudrate selection
- UART pins selection (2 options)

## Connecting
| Device UART interface  | Flipper Zero pin (default) | Flipper Zero pin (option) |
| :----------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
| RX | 13 TX | 15 TX |
| TX | 14 RX | 16 TX |
| GND  | 8, 18 GND | 8, 18 GND |

Info: If possible, do not power your devices from 3V3 (pin 9) Flipper Zero. It does not support hot plugging.

## Keyboard
UART_terminal uses its own special keyboard for work, which has all the symbols necessary for working in the console.

To accommodate more characters on a small display, some characters are called up by holding.

## Supported send AT commands
In the "Send AT command" mode, the keyboard settings are changed for the convenience of entering AT commands.

## Hex mode
Hexadecimal mode is useful for working with simple binary protocols.
You can see the bytes being received in hexadecimal in the terminal window.
You can also send binary packets to UART. A simplified keyboard is used to enter packet bytes.
